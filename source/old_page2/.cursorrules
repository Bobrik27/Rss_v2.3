You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Astro framework for scalable web development.

  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Astro examples.
  - Leverage Astro's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively.
  - Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
  - Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
  - Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.

  Astro Project Structure
  - src/
      - components/
      - layouts/
      - pages/
      - styles/
      - content/ (for Content Collections)
    - public/
    - astro.config.mjs

  Component Development
  - Create .astro files for Astro components.
  - Use framework-specific components (React) when interactivity is needed.
  - Use Astro's component props for data passing.
  - Leverage Astro's built-in components like <Markdown /> when appropriate.

  Routing and Pages
  - Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the src/pages/ directory.
  - Implement dynamic routes using [...slug].astro syntax.
  - Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.

  Content Management
  - Use Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) files for content-heavy pages (Blog, News).
  - Implement content collections in src/content/config.ts.
  - Leverage z from 'astro:content' for schema validation.

  Styling (Tailwind CSS v4)
  - We use Tailwind CSS v4.
  - Do NOT create tailwind.config.js. All configuration is in src/styles/global.css using @theme.
  - Use Tailwind utility classes extensively.
  - Never use the @apply directive if possible.

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize use of client-side JavaScript.
  - Use the client:* directives judiciously:
    - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
    - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible

  Data Fetching
  - Use getCollection() to fetch data from Content Collections.
  - Implement getStaticPaths() for fetching data at build time.

  Key Conventions
  1. Follow Astro's Style Guide.
  2. Use TypeScript interfaces for Props.
  3. Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery.
